**Introduction**: The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately forecast song popularity with a score. 
The objective is to provide music producers and artists with insights on how to create popular songs. 
The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle, including song features such as genre, acousticness, duration, energy. 
The dataset contains songs released in recent years, and the aim is to analyze the data to identify patterns and relationships 
between song features and popularity to develop an accurate predictive model.
